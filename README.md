A car park payment system allows customers to select the number of hours to leave their car in
the car park. The customer will get a discount if they enter their frequent parking number
correctly. The system calculates and displays the amount the customer must pay. The price of
parking, the number of hours the customer can enter, and any discount depend upon the day of
the week and the arrival time. The number of hours entered is a whole number. The price per
hour is calculated using the price in force at the arrival time. No parking is allowed between
Midnight and 08:00.A frequent parking number can be entered for discounted parking. This number consists of 4
digits and a check digit that is calculated using a modulo 11 check digit calculation. A discount of
50% is available for arrival times from 16:00 to Midnight; the discount is 10% at all other arrival
times.
